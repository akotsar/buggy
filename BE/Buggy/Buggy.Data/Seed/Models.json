    "description": "Since its launch in 2005, the Bugatti **Veyron** has been regarded as a supercar of superlative quality. It was a real challenge for developers to fulfil the specifications that the new supercar was supposed to meet: over 1,000 hp, a top speed of over 400 km/h and the ability to accelerate from 0 to 100 in under three seconds. \n\n Even experts thought it was impossible to achieve these performance specs on the road. But that was not all. The same year, the Super Sport fulfilled the strict requirements of Guinness World Records and set a new world speed record for road cars of 431.072 km/h. Despite numerous attempts to dethrone the Super Sport from its status as the fastest production supercar, the Bugatti remains unbeaten to this day.",

    "description": "The **Chiron** is the most modern interpretation of Bugatti’s brand DNA and embodies our new design language. The styling accentuates the performance aspect of the super sports car. The motto adopted by the Bugatti designers for the Chiron was “Form follows Performance”. Inspired through Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic the new design language is characterised by extremely generous surfaces, which are demarcated by pronounced lines in the case of the Chiron. Thereby most of these elements have a technical background and have been designed to fully accentuate the growing performance requirements of the Chiron.\n\nIn order to achieve a 25 percent increase in performance compared to its predecessor, almost every single part of the engine was looked at and newly developed. This feat of engineering resulted in the W16 engine of the Bugatti Chiron being able to develop an unbelievable 1,103 kW (1,500 bps) from its 8 litres of displacement. The engine reaches its maximum torque of 1,600 Nm thanks to the turbocharger which Bugatti actually even developed itself. The 4 turbochargers are now double-powered and already guarantee maximum torque at 2,000 rpm, and the torque is maintained at this level all the way up to 6,000 rpm. The result is unbelievable acceleration which only comes to an end in the twilight zone somewhere beyond the 400 km/h mark.",

    "description": "Lamborghini’s Super Trofeo championship has been described as the fastest one-make race series in the world. From 2015, it’s set to get even quicker. Racing in a separate class to the outgoing Gallardo, the new rear-drive **Huracán LP 620-2 Super Trofeo** features less weight, greater rigidity and more power.\n\nThe single most striking difference between Huracán road and race car is that the latter is rear-drive. Lamborghini argues this will make the Super Trofeo series more attractive to drivers seeking to progress up to GT3. It also cuts weight, while the traction advantage of all-wheel drive is less significant on track and with racing tyres. The chassis is modified to accept a larger race radiator up front and the racing gearbox at the rear, while the bodywork itself is mounted on fast fittings for pit-lane repairs. Aerodynamics have been tuned for greater downforce and drag efficiency; the rear wing has ten different downforce settings while the front air intake ducts are also adjustable.\n\nPower is provided by a 620 hp version of Lamborghini’s V10, driving through a three-disc clutch and XTrac sequential transmission. Power to weight ratio is an impressive 2.05 kilograms per horsepower (compared with 2.33 kg/hp for the roadgoing all-wheel drive model).\n\nInside the cockpit, luxuries are few but the sophisticated MOTEC M182 electronic control unit governs data, display and gearchanges while the Bosch Motorsport ABS offers 12 different traction settings that the driver can select via a control on the steering wheel. Adjustable anti-roll bars and dampers will enable drivers to set up the LP 620-2 Super Trofeo to their precise requirements, whatever the circuit or conditions.",

It was nicknamed the “Dragon Edition” and only 10 units were made, each coming with an aero kit made up of a fixed carbon fiber rear spoiler, redesigned front bumper, and rear air vents. It also had individually-numbered plaques and embroidered dragons on the doors, and most importantly, a massive performance bump that gave the Aventador’s 6.5-liter V-12 engine 760 horsepower 550 pound-feet of torque to play with.",

There are two options only: pearlescent paint ($2500) and a nav system ($3500). \n\nLamborghinis are famous for being as fragile as spring ice, so it was of some concern that our test car showed 15,500 miles-as much mule as bull. \"It's survived 35 road tests,\" asserted Lamborghini tech adviser Ken McCay, who is not Italian. \"You're the only guys who broke it [last summer, when a universal joint pulled free in the shift linkage].\" We broke it this time, too, when the whole shift lever snapped off at the root. The car came with the license \"AL 147,\" a reference to \"Automobili Lamborghini engineering project No. 147.\" Maybe project No. 148 will be devoted to shift-linkage reinforcement. What you notice first about the Murciélago is that its left-front wheel intrudes some eight inches into prime footwell territory, skewing your feet to the right. Your left foot searches for a place to relax-under the clutch is about the only comfortable spot.\n\nWhat you notice next is the accelerator pedal juts out of a small black box, like a paddle raised in a canoe.

For starters, \"Miura\" is a breed of Spanish fighting bull, and the wild Miura, with its 430-horsepower, V-12 engine mounted transversely in the rear, is so bold, individualistic and unconventional that it's hard to imagine it fitting into anybody's arbitrary standards, safety or otherwise. \n\nDifficult though the challenge may seem, we believe the normal Lamborghini 350 GT (C/D, March 1966) and perhaps even the Miura will be modified to conform to any standards the National Traffic Safety Bureau will impose. That's the kind of commercial competitor Ferruccio Lamborghini is. As a self-made man—a successful manufacturer of tractors, heating units, and air conditioners—Lamborghini's sole objective in the automobile business (expense be damned) is to surpass Ferrari, first in sales, and then in reputation. He'll do what he needs to do to sell cars in the rich American market. If his two American importer-distributors agree that there should be different headlights or an optional automatic transmission, they let Lamborghini know, and behold—the necessary modifications are made with a rapidity that would astound those familiar with the normal reaction times of Italian auto‑makers, especially the smaller firms.\n\nThere are only two other cars that can be mentioned in the same breath with the Miura. They are the Ford Mark III (C/D, June 1967) and the Ferrari 275/LM (C/D, May 1965). Both are available in road versions, but were originally built for the track, where they will always be more at home. The Miura, on the other hand, was engineered with racing as a future possibility, but was developed solely for the street. As such, it is superior in performance, space and furnishings—in everything, in short—to the other twenty-grand two-seaters.",

    "description": "Before the Ford Focus, before the Subaru WRX, and before the Mitsubishi EVO, there was the **Lancia 037 Stradale**. \nnThis vehicle is arguably one of the greatest rally cars ever created, despite winning only a single manufacturer’s title in the 1983 season of the World Rally Championship. \nYou see, the Lancia 037 accomplished that feat as a mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive platform running against the seemingly indomitable Audi Quattro. Even as the beast from Ingolstadt kicked off the sport’s inevitable mass migration to all-wheel-drive grip, the Lancia 037 somehow clawed its way to victory over the mighty German competitor. \n\nThe pitched battles fought between these two titans has become the stuff of rally legend, and now, the Lancia 037 sits as the final rear-wheel-drive car to win a WRC manufacturer’s championship.",
